//Useful tutorial if you want to create a json-server with multiple db files
https://billyyyyy3320.com/en/2019/07/21/create-json-server-with-multiple-files/



/* Basic Steps */

//should be ran globally:
//json-server is responsible for serving the data
// -g installs global and is excluded from the package.json in project root directory

/* *Only have to perform this one on your computer. */
npm i -g json-server


/* The following commands are perform for each project */

//should be run inside the root project directory
npm init -y

// allows you to install multiple packages at once
npm i concurrently jquery bootstrap


//must be added into scripts of the package JSON
//json-server can have a custom IP
//live server can have a custom port
//db.json is a local database.

//replace 192.168.50.56 with your own ip address or remove to use localhost
"start": "concurrently \"json-server --host 192.168.50.56 db.json\" \"live-server --port=8090 \""



/* Basic db.json format with multiple routes */
ex. 
//syntax example
//ip:port/route1
//http://yourcustomip:yourcustomPort/yourCustomRoute

{
    "route1": [
        {"objectName": "objectValue"}
    ],
    "route2": [
        {"objectName": "objectValue"}
    ]
}

//sample boiler plate JSON object
//127.0.0.1:3000/posts
//localhost:3000/imageData
//192.168.50.56/foodData


{
  "posts": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "john doe", "author": "johnny" }
  ],
  "imageData": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "image1", "imageUrlData": "./images/image1.jpg" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "image2", "imageUrlData": "./images/image2.jpg" },
    { "id": 3, "name": "image3", "imageUrlData": "./images/image3.jpg" }
  ],
  "foodData": { "foodName": "Apple Pie", foodIngredients: [{"ingredient1": "Apples", "ingredient2": "Crust", "ingredient3": "Brown Sugar" }] "foodPrice": "8.00", "foodDescription": "Apple pie is a dish of apple with a crust. It is usually served at room temperature." },
}





/* Options Commands and Tips */

//When initial data is ready you can cd into root directory of db.json and run:
json-server --watch db.json

//Allows you to add a unique ip to pull server data from.
json-server --host 192.168.50.56 db.json
